# Readarr

### Readarr is in early stages of development, alpha/beta binary builds are not yet available. Use of any test builds isn't recommend, and may have detrimental effects on your library.

Readarr is a ebook (and maybe eventually magazine/audiobook) collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new books from your favorite authors and will grab, sort and rename them.

## Major Features Include:

* Support for major platforms: Windows, Linux, macOS, Raspberry Pi, etc.
* Automatically detects new books.
* Can scan your existing library and download any missing books.
* Automatic failed download handling will try another release if one fails
* Manual search so you can pick any release or to see why a release was not downloaded automatically
* Fully configurable book renaming
* Full integration with SABnzbd and NZBGet
* Full integration with Calibre (add to library, conversion)
* And a beautiful UI
